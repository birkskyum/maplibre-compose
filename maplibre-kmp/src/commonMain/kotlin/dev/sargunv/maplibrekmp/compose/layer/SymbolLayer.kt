 *   A value in the range of `[0..24]`.
 *
 * @param maxZoom
 *   The maximum zoom level for the layer. At zoom levels equal to or greater than this, the layer
 *   will be hidden. A value in the range of `[0..24]`.
 *
 * @param filter
 *   An expression specifying conditions on source features. Only features that match the filter are

 *   Features with a higher sort key will appear above features with a lower sort key.
 *
 * @param zOrder
 *   Determines whether overlapping symbols in the same layer are rendered in the order that they
 *   appear in the data source or by their y-position relative to the viewport. To control the order
 *   and prioritization of symbols otherwise, use [sortKey]. See [SymbolSortOrder].

 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.
 *
 * @param iconOffset
 *   Offset distance of icon from its anchor. Positive values indicate right and down, while
 *   negative values indicate left and up. Each component is multiplied by the value of [iconSize]

 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textMaxWidth
 *   The maximum line width in ems for text wrapping.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textLineHeight
 *   Text leading value in ems for multi-line text.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textLetterSpacing
 *   Text tracking amount in ems.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textJustify
 *   Text justification options. See [TextJustify].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textRadialOffset
 *   Radial offset of text, in the direction of the symbol's anchor. Useful in combination with
 *   [textVariableAnchor], which defaults to using the two-dimensional [textOffset] if present.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textVariableAnchor
 *   To increase the chance of placing high-priority labels on the map, you can provide an array of
 *   [textAnchor] locations: the renderer will attempt to place the label at each location, in
 *   order, before moving onto the next label. Use [textJustify] = [TextJustify.Auto] to choose
 *   justification based on anchor position. To apply an offset, use the [textRadialOffset] or the
 *   two-dimensional [textOffset].
 *
 *   Only applicable if [placement] is [SymbolPlacement.Point].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textVariableAnchorOffset
 *   To increase the chance of placing high-priority labels on the map, you can provide an array of
 *   [SymbolAnchor] locations, each paired with an offset value. The renderer will attempt to place
 *   the label at each location, in order, before moving on to the next location+offset.
 *   Use [textJustify] = [TextJustify.Auto] to choose justification based on anchor position.
 *
 *   Each anchor location is accompanied by a point which defines the offset when the corresponding
 *   anchor location is used. Positive offset values indicate right and down, while negative values
 *   indicate left and up. Anchor locations may repeat, allowing the renderer to try multiple
 *   offsets to try and place a label using the same anchor.
 *
 *   When present, this property takes precedence over [textAnchor], [textVariableAnchor],
 *   [textOffset] and [textRadialOffset].
 *
 *   Example:
 *   ```
 *   listOf(
 *     SymbolAnchor.Top to Point(0, 4),
 *     SymbolAnchor.Left to Point(3, 0),
 *     SymbolAnchor.Bottom to Point(1, 1)
 *   ```
 *   When the renderer chooses the top anchor, [0, 4] will be used for [textOffset]; the text will
 *   be shifted down by 4 ems. When the renderer chooses the left anchor, [3, 0] will be used for [textOffset]; the text will
 *   be shifted right by 3 ems. Etc.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textAnchor
 *   Part of the text placed closest to the anchor. See [SymbolAnchor].
 *
 *   Overridden by [textVariableAnchorOffset].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textMaxAngle
 *   Maximum angle change in degrees between adjacent characters.
 *
 *   Only applicable if [placement] is [SymbolPlacement.Line] or [SymbolPlacement.LineCenter]
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textWritingMode
 *   The property allows control over a symbol's orientation. Note that the property values act as a
 *   hint, so that a symbol whose language doesn’t support the provided orientation will be laid out
 *   in its natural orientation. Example: English point symbol will be rendered horizontally even if
 *   array value contains single 'vertical' enum value. The order of elements in an array define
 *   priority order for the placement of an orientation variant. See [TextWritingMode]
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textRotate
 *   Rotates the text clockwise. Unit in degrees.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textPadding
 *   Size of the additional area in dp around the text bounding box used for detecting symbol
 *   collisions.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textKeepUpright
 *   If true, the text may be flipped vertically to prevent it from being rendered upside-down.
 *
 *   Only applicable if [textRotationAlignment] is [TextRotationAlignment.Map] and
 *   [placement] is [SymbolPlacement.Line] or [SymbolPlacement.LineCenter]
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textTransform
 *   Specifies how to capitalize text. See [TextTransform].
 *
 * @param textOffset
 *   Offset distance of text from its anchor in ems. Positive values indicate right and down, while
 *   negative values indicate left and up. If used with [textVariableAnchor], input values will be
 *   taken as absolute values. Offsets along the x- and y-axis will be applied automatically based
 *   on the anchor position.
 *
 *   Overridden by [textRadialOffset].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textAllowOverlap
 *   If true, the text will be visible even if it collides with other previously drawn symbols.
 *
 *   Overridden by [textOverlap].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textOverlap
 *   Controls whether to show an icon/text when it overlaps other symbols on the map.
 *   See [SymbolOverlap]. Overrides [textAllowOverlap].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 *   **Note**: This property is not supported on native platforms, yet.
 *
 * @param textIgnorePlacement
 *   If true, other symbols can be visible even if they collide with the text.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textOptional
 *   If true, icons will display without their corresponding text when the text collides with other
 *   symbols and the icon does not.
 *
 *   Ignored if not both [textField] and [iconImage] are specified.
 *
 * @param textOpacity
 *   The opacity at which the text will be drawn.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textColor
 *   The color with which the text will be drawn.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textHaloColor
 *   The color of the text's halo, which helps it stand out from backgrounds.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textHaloBlur
 *   The halo's fadeout distance towards the outside in dp.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textTranslate
 *   Distance that the text's anchor is moved from its original placement in dp. Positive values
 *   indicate right and down, while negative values indicate left and up.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textTranslateAnchor
 *   Controls the frame of reference for [textTranslate]. See [TranslateAnchor].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
