## Usage

See the
[Getting Started guide](https://sargunv.github.io/maplibre-compose/getting-started/)
in the documentation.

## Status

Many common use cases are already supported, but the full breadth of the
MapLibre SDKs is not yet covered. What is already supported may have bugs. API
stability is not yet guaranteed; as we're still exploring how best to express an
interactive map API in Compose.

Android and iOS support is implemented with
[MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native).

Desktop and Web are not yet supported.
